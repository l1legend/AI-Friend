# Getting Started with AI Friend.
Open the project with VSCode.
In the root directory create a file called .env

Go to the following link:
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Here is where you generate your OpenAI API keys.
You need to have some credits available so go to you the Billing tab and fund your account. $5 is plenty.
Click the API keys tab on the left, then click "Create new secret key". Copy the API and paste it in notepad. 

Back in VSCode inside the .env file add your API key. (Add your key between the double quotes".)

API_KEY ="<your_key_here>"


## Usage
In the project directory, open two terminals.

In the first terminal enter the command:
### `npm start:frontend`

In the second terminal enter the command:
### `npm start:backend`

The web application should automatically open in the browser.
